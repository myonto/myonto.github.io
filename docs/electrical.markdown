<h1>Electrical</h1>
In order to track the effectiveness of treatments, a method of measuring the relative ‘sweatiness’ of the hand had to be developed. The Galvanic Skin Response test measures the electrical resistance of the skin in order to get a resistance reading. As the resistance reading is a function of active sweat glands, the lower the resistance reading, the ‘sweatier’ a hand is.
