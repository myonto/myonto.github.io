In order to build our ML training model, we need to gather enough data to later label and identify trends. This requires a robust portable system that the entire FYDP group can use when needed. This is essentially a better, more presentable version of the sensing prototype system seen in the figure below.

The electrodes to be used in the project were previously sourced (see FYDP presentation), but preparation still needed to be done. The carbon surface is “hidden” under an adhesive layer that can be seen below. Removing this layer with isopropyl alcohol yielded the best surface finish for our needs.

Verification of the electrodes was done by measuring the continuity and resistance of adhesive and non-adhesive covered electrodes. Both yielded continuity and measurements of 0.9v through the multimeter. This proves that the preparation of the electrode surface does not diminish the functionality. 

The housing was then designed to hold a phone and electrodes in place. There is also a compartment below to hold the sensing circuitry and controller necessary to read the “sweatiness level”. This assembly is shown in the following figure.

After 26 hours of 3D printing and replicating the sensing circuit on a smaller breadboard, the result can be seen below.
