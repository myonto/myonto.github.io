Recently, the main focus of the project has been improving the prototype and getting closer to a final mechanical system. The old prototype relied on water as the conducting medium, tape to provide sealing, and aluminum foil was used for the electrodes.

The nitrile glove will continue to be used since it is easy to source and patients can dispose of it after every treatment. An iontophoresis gel has been purchased to replace the water. Using a gel will make the sealing easier and help avoid splashing. Tape will be replaced with a medical tourniquet to seal the glove so the gel doesnâ€™t leak. The tourniquet fits virtually all arm sizes and can be re-used without limit. An arm mechanism is designed to hold two tourniquets and the ground electrode.

The arm mechanism is 3D printed and assembled as shown below.

One of our group members underwent a 10-minute treatment on each hand. Hand wetness was measured before treatment, immediately after, then at 10, 30, and 60 minutes afterwards. Data can be seen below.

The new prototype functionally works and includes the necessary components. In further iterations the ergonomics of the design will be improved. The tourniquet is also a bit challenging to connect if operating this device alone. Other fastening methods will be investigated. The data collected still shows very strong results and proves that the iontophoresis procedure works with this new prototype.
