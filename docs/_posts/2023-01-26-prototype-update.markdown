MyOnto aims to help with the symptoms of Hyperhidrosis. This condition leads to excessive sweating which is not related to physical activity or ambient temperature. Iontophoresis has been identified as a way to treat the condition. The main concern with current iontophoresis machines is the mobility restriction it places on users. It requires the patient to place their hands in separate electrically charged pools of water and then switch hands to repeat the procedure so that both hands are treated. The ions in the pools of water travel into the skin and clog the sweat pores and help with Hyperhidrosis. The team has decided to solve this problem by creating a glove system that can allow patients to move around and do daily tasks while iontophoresis takes place on their extremities. A potential solution for iontophoresis for the feet can also be made possible using the same basic principles. The team’s design will allow users to track treatment efficacy, a feature unavailable in current products. The initial glove prototype can be seen below.

The ’pool’ of water is inside the glove. An electrode was inserted to allow for electrical current to flow. This system was tested with all group members. Hand wetness measurements were taken before and after a five-minute treatment. The data can be seen below.

The data shows that every group member’s hand was drier after the treatment. Prototype assembly and data collection were done through November and December of 2022. This shows that MyOnto has a strong chance of succeeding as the device is further developed. The next steps for this group will be to work on a better-quality physical prototype, an app to communicate with patients, and an electrical system to validate treatment efficacy.
