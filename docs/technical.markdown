<h1>Design</h1>
 The system is designed to be capable of the iontophoresis treatment process for hyperhidrosis. The methodology of achieving iontophoresis must allow the user to retain mobility, such as being able to interact with a coffee cup. This methodology must also be safe and usable by most users. The treatment effectiveness must be quantifiable, and the relevant data should be easily understood by the user.
