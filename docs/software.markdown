<h1>Software</h1>
The goal of the software development for this project is for the purposes of data tracking and treatment schedule recommendation. To accomplish this, the proposed solution is to have a smartphone application interfacing with the treatment delivery and sweat sensing system. This application will act as a data storage that would enable data tracking, and with the modern smartphone capable of machine learning, the smartphone device would act as the data processor for treatment scheduling. The data is to be collected from the electronics package during treatment delivery and it is to be shared with the smartphone, which may then process the data.
